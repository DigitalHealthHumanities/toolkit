projecttitle: "Examining Horror-Related Language in Early HIV/AIDS Discourse"
projectblurb: "The project aims to answer this research question: How did the use of horror-related language in media and public discourse influence societal perceptions and stigmatization of HIV/AIDS during the onset of the epidemic in the United States?<br>During the early stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, the use of horror-related language and imagery in media and public discourse manipulated how people viewed and stigmatized the disease. Words/phrases like “vampire” (or its cognates), “pollution,” “plague,” “death sentence,” and “infectious monster” heightened the alarm and misunderstandings about the disease, leading to increased stigma and discrimination against affected individuals. This language also affected public health policies and responses, often resulting in punitive measures rather than benevolent approaches. Mainstream media and communication perpetuated these fear-inducing narratives, while alternative media occasionally offered different perspectives. Overall, the horror-themed discourse surrounding HIV/AIDS not only increased the collective fear but also thwarted effective public health interventions and intensified the disregard for affected individuals."
