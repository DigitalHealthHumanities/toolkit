**This lesson will reference the Research Questions Lesson. If you have not done that lesson, you may want to before taking this one.**

Starting any research project can be difficult. You might be forced to answer a litany of questions all at once, questions that are all in some ways dependent on one another for the project to succeed.

Questions like:
-	What are your research questions?
-	What are your research objects?
-	Who are your interlocutors?
-	With what fields are you conversing?
-	What is the potential scholarly value of this project?
-	What method(s) are you planning on using for this project?
-	Why does this matter?

When doing a digital humanities project you have to answer a whole extra group of questions, like:
-	What digital method are you using?
-	How are you going to learn that method?
-	What other methods do you need to learn to actually get the project in order?
-	What is your data?
-	How will you use your data?

It can feel like you might have to do your own research project just to have the answers to begin a new one.
For some folx, this is how research is done. They know their field inside and out and have done some variation on their research in the past, so they can answer these questions simply and quickly.

For the rest of us, however, a new research project begins with a whole mess of new things we have to learn. For the digital humanities, the things we might need to learn are endless, complicated, and while they share some conceptual overlap, different methods means learning entirely new protocols, platforms, and approaches to knowledge work.

What this lesson will teach you are some ways to quickly assess your research objects, research questions, and methodologies to determine how they fit together. **Some research questions better lend themselves to specific research methodologies**, and the goal of this lesson is to help cross out specific methods to save you time later in your research.

As discussed in the Research Questions Lesson, research questions preclude specific answers. Just as a yes/no question only can be answered by those two choices, certain other questions can only be answered in specific ways. A question like “what metaphors were used when describing cancer patients?” will lead to different answers than a question like “How did ideas and approaches to cancer change over time.” While they share a similar main interest—cancer—the questions themselves assume a method. For the former, it may be close reading and personal experience, as Susan Sontag applied in her essay *Illness as Metaphor*.[^1] For the latter, it may be working in archives to do a history, as Siddhartha Mukherjee did for *The Emperor of All Maladies*.[^2]

<p style="margin-left:40">Important Term – Methodology: Methodology refers to the study of approaches to research. Generally a methodology in a scholarly publication refers to the specific steps taken to achieve the research outcomes. Some methods can be quite loose—like close reading in the humanities—or quite rigid as with experimental methods in the sciences.</p>

Our research objects can also change what methodology a scholar chooses. The two examples above use different methods with slightly different primary objects. A scholar looking at the ads published by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure organization may ask very different questions—like ones on the relationship between non-profits and medical research--than Sontag or Mukherjee. Likewise, someone using demographic data regarding regional differences in cancer rates, would have very different research questions, methods, and findings than their peers.

<p style="margin-left:40">**Important Term—Research Object:** A research object is anything that is the direct target of the research. It is something discrete and defined that can be analyzed by a researcher using a specific method. For historians, their research objects are often primary materials; for the example on mapping cancer rates, the object would be the demographic data that the researcher would analyze.</p>

None of these research questions, research objects, or research methods can be chosen separately. They all depend on each other.

[!!!! An image of the three together]

This all said as scholars we don’t have to go into doing our research knowing each of these three pillars. We can have one or two of them in mind when beginning a project.

I could know that I want to do research on transgender healthcare, with an interest in pursuing interviews with trans people and medical providers. I could know that I want to do research on the news reception around the Covid-19 pandemic, using topic modelling. I could know that I want to use [Helen Fahl Gofman’s papers]( https://calisphere.org/collections/28068/) for something related to the history of development research.

Knowing one or two of the three legs of your research can help eliminate potential methods, objects, or research questions, because those decisions foreclose potential research avenues.

What this exercise will do is help show how a research method can inform one’s approach to a research object.
There are four exercises in this lesson. The first lesson is an exercise in getting to understand a small set of research objects and think about them as data. The next three lessons will use that same collection of objects for different digital methods—textual analysis, network graphing, and geospatial analysis. 

You will be encouraged to engage with these materials through an analog approach.[^3] You will be asked to draw, sketch, write out, or mark-up materials. I would encourage you to work by hand, in a notebook by your computer, on a scratch piece of paper, or using a whiteboard program (like [Microsoft Whiteboard]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-whiteboard/digital-whiteboard-app))., to make notes as you work.
