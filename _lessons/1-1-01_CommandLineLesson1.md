The command line—accessed through the Command Prompt on Windows machines and the Terminal on Mac computers—is a text based interface to access files and programs on your computer. 

Early computers ran entirely on text-based prompts, but a turn to graphic user interfaces (GUI), popularized by the early Macintosh computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, shifted how most users interacted with these machines. GUI refers to the kind of interface that responds to inputs by the mouse, and can be navigated through non-textual inputs.  

Think about how you might access a file in your documents folder: you might click on the Finder, if you are using a mac, and then click on the tab on the left hand side of the finder, and then click on the file itself. By clicking through these folders you are interacting with files in a structured hierarchy that can be accessed through the command line as well. 

That document on a Mac computer might be located here: 

    /Users/[username]/documents/[filename] 

For Windows users, the file would be located like so: 

    \Users\[username]\documents\[filename] 

What the graphic user interface does is that it navigates and operates the text-based and code-based operations in the computer. It lets users go through the computer in a way that makes sense for those who are less tech savvy. 

The GUI is great and has made computers a lot easier for beginning users. It, however, has some limitations when we want to do code-based research. Often code tutorials assume that basic aptitudes, like navigating the command line, installing dependencies, or running prompts within the command line. This introduction to the command line will outline some skills for digital novices, that will be applicable for a range of programs and digital methods. 

This tutorial is split for Mac users and Windows users because some of the commands are slightly different for these interfaces.
