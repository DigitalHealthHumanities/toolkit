**Required: You will need to download and unzip the [command prompt files](https://ucsf.box.com/s/xlyqx9t24e2su78ww2jh52f6xc2xp4va) for this lesson.**

To open the command line on Windows, you will need to open the application called Command Prompt. When you do, you’ll find yourself looking at a pretty basic interface.

The only way to interact with this interface is with typed commands. The command line is very simple, and it only knows how to run functions that are specifically formatted for it. So if I type in something like “go to documents” it will give me an error code: “'go' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.” 

One thing to remember whenever we’re working in the command line (or working with code) is that these processes only work if they are given a specific set of inputs with which the program is designed to operate. This means that if you want to use the command line, you have to use a set of predetermined inputs that will output specific results.
