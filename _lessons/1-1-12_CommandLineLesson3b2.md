This simple function can be helpful in parsing large numbers of text files for specific information. The dataset we’re using in this exercise comes from a larger collection of books—a corpus—which have information about a range of issues related to tuberculosis around the turn of the twentieth century. 

Find helps us parse information based on what we might already know about our project or research question. We can use find to help find texts that may be valuable for our research. 

For example, in the previous section I asked for you to search tuberculin. Tuberculin was a pharmaceutical developed by Robert Koch to try to cure tuberculosis. Its clinical effectiveness was disproven, but it was something that doctors tested as a potential cure. It was also used as a test for tuberculosis. 

What you’ll notice if you search for tuberculin that some books cite it quite a bit, and others do not mention it at all. If your research project involved that compound, those trials, or its use as a test for tuberculosis, then you would have a clear idea of what books might be most valuable to read first. 

<p>There are some limitations: find only really works for one string at a time, so if you were searching for something that has different names (tuberculosis vs. pthisis vs. consumption for example) you might run into issues finding relevant work. (Although, you can use the ‘*’ to search for terms that begin or end with a specific string of characters—"tubercul*” would search for “tuberculosis” and “tuberculous” and “patholog*” would search for “pathology” “pathological” and so on . . .)</p>
